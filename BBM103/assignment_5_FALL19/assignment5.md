# Assignment 5 - Understanding Data

In this experiment, you will implement a simple Single Layer Neural Network in order to solve a real wold machine learning problem with a real world data. In this experiment, you will get familiar Python data science libraries such as; Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib. At the end, you will train the neural network to classify clinical cases to either benign or malignant.

- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Single Layer Neural Network from Scratch
