# Assignment 4 - Identic Color Game

In this assignment, you will get familiar with file operations, lists, higher order functions, exceptions, and design a relatively complex algorithm. You are expected to design a game called IdenticColorGame. This game is played on a rectangular board, typically initially filled with different colored balls. By selecting a group of adjoining balls of the same color, a player may remove them from the screen. Balls that are no longer supported will fall down, and a column without any balls will be trimmed away by other columns always sliding to the left side. The goal of the game is to remove as many balls from the playing field as possible.
